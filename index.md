### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I was always intrigued by how the game of Blackjack operated but had no idea how to play it. Developing this program can be beneficial to the individuals who might utilize it for practice. I was able to build functions that calculated the right 
    value of a Blackjack hand. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was also my favorite since I learned how to write a program that will assist me in determining whether street parking is permitted based on posted signs.  We have a lot of signs and regulations in California about where and when to park, which can be confusing at times. I learned how to develop functions that enforce parking restrictions on signs.
    
* Lab 11
    
    Lab 11 part 2 This was one of my favorites since I enjoyed working on something that generated a random guessing game. I learned how to create a random number generator code. I also enjoyed putting the code to the test and seeing how long it took me to predict the correct number.
